* put hats/bass+snare mix on a single knob
* make pitch knob instead do - inversion of notes, reverse of sequence, for 5th, 3rd, 7th
* beat shift = slow/speed beat at the end

* beat-timed delay fx
* ring mod effect (tuned?)
* distortion effect (foldover?)

* solo instrument? (touch)

Next tune:
	* have some devilfish style squeaky acid with slow filter-opens in there
	* start with the beat?
